We will also go through tutorials to help learning. We will walk you through what 
you need before we start.

First you will need to download the [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) sdk from Microsoft.
You will also need something to edit your code in. The best option for this is vscode as it is not
limited to only windows.

With vscode installed go to the extensions tab and search C#. Install the C# Dev Kit extension.
